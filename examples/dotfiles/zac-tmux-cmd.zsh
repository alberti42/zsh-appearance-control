# EXAMPLE — not a drop-in.
#
# Snapshot of the author's private dotfiles (zinit/src/zac/zac-tmux-cmd.zsh), taken 2026-08-19. Not
# refreshed automatically.
#
# What it demonstrates
#   - tmux as a *consumer* of the appearance, not as its transport: since 2.0.0
#     neither the plugin nor the dispatcher touches a tmux option, so the user
#     owns @dark_appearance;
#   - the subset of appearance state that lives in the tmux server's memory and
#     is therefore lost on a server restart. Keeping it in its own tiny helper
#     lets two callers share one source of truth: this script is run by
#     ZAC_IO_CMD on every transition, and by tmux.conf at server start — the
#     latter giving a fresh server the right options without redoing the heavy
#     I/O of the io script.
#
# Depends on $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_CATPPUCCIN and the author's fzf snippet.

# ZAC_TMUX_CMD — tmux-server-resident appearance settings.
#
# This is the SUBSET of appearance state that lives in the running tmux server's
# memory and is therefore LOST on a server restart — unlike the on-disk config
# files and symlinks that zac-io-cmd writes, which persist across restarts.
#
# It is intentionally tiny and free of side effects beyond `tmux set-option`, so
# it is cheap to run both:
#   - on every appearance transition  (executed by zac-io-cmd), and
#   - on every tmux server start      (executed by tmux.conf via run-shell),
# the latter being what gives a fresh server the right config without re-doing
# zac-io-cmd's heavy global I/O (file rewrites, patina restart, …).
#
# Called as: zac-tmux-cmd <0|1>
#
# .zshenv is sourced automatically (no -f flag on the shebang), so DOTFILES_DIR
# and the bootstrap helpers are available. Requires FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_CATPPUCCIN;
# sources the fzf atinit hook itself if a caller has not already populated it.
#
# Non-zero exit propagates to zac-io-cmd, which aborts the dispatch pipeline.
