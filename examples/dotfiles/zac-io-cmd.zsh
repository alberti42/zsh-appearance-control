# EXAMPLE — not a drop-in.
#
# Source:      zinit/src/zac/zac-io-cmd.zsh  (a private dotfiles repo)
# Snapshot:    2026-08-19
# Tested with: zsh-appearance-control v2.2.0
#
# Snapshots are allowed to diverge from their originals — the private copy
# keeps evolving. What must not go stale is the 'Tested with' line: it is a
# claim that this file was actually run against that release of the plugin,
# so it is bumped by hand after re-testing, never automatically.
#
# What it demonstrates
#   - the ZAC_IO_CMD contract: one executable, called as `<script> <0|1>`, run
#     once per real transition by bin/appearance-dispatch;
#   - why a non-zero exit is expensive: it aborts the dispatch, so no ground
#     truth is written and no shell is signalled. Every step therefore reports
#     0 (applied), 2 (skipped, not installed on this host) or 1 (real failure),
#     and only 1 aborts. One missing ~/.claude.json used to leave a whole
#     machine with no appearance at all;
#   - the same file rewritten for many consumers (yazi, btop, patina, claude,
#     opencode, IPython) plus symlink flips (vivid's LS_COLORS, a git theme
#     include), with the file mode preserved across the temp-file rewrite;
#   - choosing the values once into variables instead of duplicating every
#     command in a dark/light if-else, which is how the two copies drifted.
#
# Everything about *which* tools are themed is the author's; the shape is the
# transferable part.

# ZAC_IO_CMD — heavy I/O for appearance changes.
#
# Called by appearance-dispatch as: zac-io-cmd <0|1>
#
# .zshenv is sourced automatically (no -f flag on the shebang), so DOTFILES_DIR,
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME, and XDG_STATE_HOME are available.
#
# Non-zero exit aborts the dispatch pipeline (no ground truth written, no USR1
# sent), so this script must fail ONLY on a real error.
#
# A consumer that is not installed on this host is NOT an error. The same
# dotfiles are used on machines with different tools — a Linux box with no
# claude, no opencode, no tmux server — and an absent config file used to abort
# the whole pipeline, leaving every shell on that host with no appearance at all.
# Missing files are therefore skipped with a note; only a failing rewrite or a
# failing tool aborts.
#
# The two appearances differ only in a handful of values, so they are chosen
# once into variables and applied by a single sequence of calls. The previous
# version duplicated every command in an if/else and the two copies had already
# drifted (the light btop rule had lost its `^` anchor).
